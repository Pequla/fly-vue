# Fly Vue - 20min From Start to App

Personal challenge project written in Vue 3 using TypeScript in WebStorm IDE

### Challenge rules:

- Only 20 minutes to generate and code the application
- No external styling libraries
- No external help, only you and keyboard
- You can use any IDE
- Use data from an API
- You must use TypeScript

> If you want to participate in challenge you can do so, after you are done message me on Discord so that I can list your project in this readme file

### Future plans for the project:

So far I am satisfied by what I was able to do in such a short period of time with no documentation or internet. Maybe at some point I end up finishing all the styling so the app looks "baller".
